/**
 * The §4.2 canonical device twin.
 *
 * A [DeviceTwin] is the system's local,
 * source-of-truth view of one physical
 * (or virtual) device. The twin is what
 * the UI displays, what automations read,
 * and what the audit log records. The
 * protocol adapters **populate** the twin
 * from the device's actual state; the
 * automation engine **commands** the
 * adapter via the twin.
 *
 * The twin is intentionally **immutable**
 * (Kotlin `data class`). Every state
 * change produces a new twin; the
 * previous twin is the "last known good".
 * The Hub persists a ring of recent
 * twins per device; the Android app and
 * desktop agents mirror.
 *
 * ## Why a twin and not a mutable device
 *
 * A mutable device object would let an
 * adapter mutate the canonical state
 * without going through the §28
 * automation engine. The twin is the
 * *boundary* between the adapter (which
 * reads from a real device) and the
 * engine (which decides what to do).
 * Mutations cross the boundary as
 * "new twin instances".
