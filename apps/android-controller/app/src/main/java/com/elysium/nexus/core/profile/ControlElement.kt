/**
 * A single control the user has placed on the touch
 * surface.
 *
 * `MASTER_ORDER.md` §15 specifies the data class. For
 * 1.1 the implementation is the §15 shape with the
 * following knobs:
 *
 *  - `id` — a stable identifier (UUID in 1.2+; the
 *    short-form `id: Int` is the 1.1 placeholder; the
 *    Room entity will have its own auto-generated id).
 *  - `type` — the kind of control (button, stick,
 *    trigger, dpad, touchpad).
 *  - `visualBounds` — the rect the control *draws*
 *    within, in normalized coordinates.
 *  - `hitBounds` — the rect the control *consumes
 *    touches* from. By default equal to `visualBounds`;
 *    the user can grow the hitbox beyond the visual
 *    bounds (§15 "Aumentar hitbox").
 *  - `zIndex` — draw order. Higher = on top.
 *  - `rotation` — visual rotation in degrees (0..360).
 *  - `opacity` — 0.0 (invisible) to 1.0 (opaque).
 *  - `binding` — what the control emits (canonical
 *    button, stick, trigger, etc.).
 *  - `behavior` — the per-type behaviour (Phase 1.2+).
 *  - `accessibility` — accessibility metadata
 *    (Phase 1.2+).
 *
 * ## Why the bounds are separate from the type
 *
 * A `Button` and a `Stick` are both drawn as a
 * rectangle; the difference is what they *do*. Keeping
 * the visual shape orthogonal to the type means the
 * editor can resize a control without changing its
 * semantic. A `Stick` of size 100x100 px is a small
 * thumbstick; the same `Stick` of size 200x200 is a
 * full-size analog stick. The editor cares only about
 * `visualBounds`; the `Mapping and Profile Engine`
 * cares only about `binding`.
 *
 * ## Why `id: Int` in 1.1
 *
 * The domain shape is a stable identifier; `Int` is the
 * 1.1 placeholder. Phase 1.2 promotes to `UUID` (or
 * `ULong` if we want to keep the JVM-native type). The
 * Room entity will have its own auto-generated `id`
 * (separate from the domain `id`); the mapping
 * domain-id ↔ entity-id lives in the repository.
