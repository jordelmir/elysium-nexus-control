/**
 * Pure-Kotlin touch event dispatcher.
 *
 * Sits between the Android `MotionEvent` stream (which lives
 * in [com.elysium.nexus.input.TouchSurfaceView]) and the
 * engine's `submitTouchPoint`. The dispatcher's job is to
 * turn the action / pointer stream into a stream of
 * per-pointer add / update / remove callbacks, in a way
 * that is testable from the JVM without an `android.jar`.
 *
 * ## Why a class with a callback
 *
 * Per the agent-memory lesson on `Context`-dependent
 * code, the dispatcher exposes a narrow callback shape
 * (`(id: Int, point: TouchPoint?) -> Unit`) that captures
 * only the values the engine actually consumes. The
 * production caller wires the callback to
 * `engine.submitTouchPoint`; tests wire it to a recording
 * lambda. The dispatcher itself has no dependency on
 * `CanonicalInputEngine`, on Android, on coroutines, or
 * on any global state.
 *
 * ## State model
 *
 * The dispatcher holds a `mutableMapOf<Int, PointerInfo>`
 * of "currently active pointers". Every [process] call
 * updates the map and emits the appropriate callbacks. The
 * map is the only state; resetting it (e.g. on
 * `TouchAction.Cancel` or on an explicit [reset] call)
 * emits a removal callback for every still-tracked
 * pointer. This guarantees that the engine never holds a
 * stale touch when the dispatcher is reset.

     *
     * Per §11, every event that *removes* a pointer emits
     * a `null` callback. Per §38, the dispatcher's state is
     * always coherent: the engine never sees a "removed"
     * pointer followed by a `Move` event that re-asserts
     * the same pointer.
